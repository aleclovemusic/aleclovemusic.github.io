                    <p class="blogpost ">I had the pleasure to work on this short film, not only as the soundtrack composer, but also as the sound mixer and sound editor.</p>

                            The editing of the project itself took much longer than expected despite 
                            shooting the entire film in less than 24 hours. This was in part due
                            to some solo travelling I did during the summer of 2023, and also because
                            I had a fall semester of on-campus classes that took me away from my home studio. 
                            During mid-August, before the start of the semester, I visited Jackbox
                            Games' studio in Chicago, and Nate Sandberg was kind enough to give me a tour
                            of the building, making note of the voice-over booths where they recorded the fart
                            sounds that were used in the game. At the time they were on track to complete
                            Party Pack 10 in the coming months, and I had quite a bit of fun meeting the crew,
                            which is a group of lovely, passionate people and the atmosphere was very welcoming.
                            <img src="" alt="">
                            The following morning, I drove to Indianapolis to watch
                            the Drum Corps International Semifinals. One of my percussion friends from college played in the
                            Madison Scouts that year. Tried my best to experience nightlife in the big cities but
                            in the attempt to spare my bank account, there was a lot more walking than there were 
                            cocktails, but overall the experience was a positive one.
                            <img src="" alt="">
                            As the semester quickly began ramping up, I had significantly more duties on the job 
                            as the A/V junior tech lead at the CMU School of Music. Can't share too many details
                            on that front, but I was grateful to be around people who support me and care about my
                            well being, I'm convinced I would have been in a much worse state at the end of the
                            semester, if not for them.
                            <img src="" alt="">
                            After the end of the semester I resumed my work on the sound, music, foley, and SFX
                            for Reverie with few interruptions, and it was at this time that I was able to get 
                            my hands on the Sennheiser HD 599 open-back headphones (which Sennheiser's reputation
                            precedes them, as they are one of the best companies for showing how poorly-mixed 
                            your audio is), the new cans really helped out immensely. The Reverie short was
                            released before I was able to hear how the TV (which was added in-post) audio integrated 
                            with the mix, but the YouTube version of the short film out there as a proof-of-concept 
                            for the eventual feature film.
                            There is an additional version that we will be sumbitting to competitions, which has 
                            audio that I re-mixed after some timing changes. 
                            Right now we are unsure if it is going to be 
                            made available to the public. The feature-length Reverie, Alex Adam's capstone 
                            project, will be filmed this summer! I will be the designated audio supervisor
                            as well as the soundtrack composer, and I couldn't be more excited. However,
                            do need some help to fund this project and we would appreciate any contributions,
                            no matter how small, to make this film a reality. Below is a link to the GoFundMe page:
